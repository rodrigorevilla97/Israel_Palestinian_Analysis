October, 2023.

This project is a brief analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict from the year 2000 to 2023 (it does not include the 
latest events that occurred in the month of October). 

As I already explained in the project, it is not an analysis 
from which to obtain reliable information since we do not know 
whether or not the database has any type of bias that could affect 
the extraction of conclusions.

It is therefore a fictitious practical exercise and a presentation 
of the data with its subsequent extraction of conclusions.
